Version 1.1.6 \
Alarm Wizard is an application that allows you to do advanced scheduling with an alarm clock, such as reminding yourself when it is time to take certain pills, as well as many other timely things. This application ties into the alarm clock, and using it, you will have the alarm clock follow a set schedule, alerting you many times per day, week, or month.  It's really great, because you know that this is not possible with the current alarm clock, as you can only enter one time for the alarm clock to alert in a 24-hour period. Keep your schedule in this application, and you won't have to worry that you may forget any scheduled events. Alarm Wizard will remind you about all of these important things! \
