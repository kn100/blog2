Amphibian Armageddon is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The object of the game is to be the last ant in the pond, which is achieved by not falling off of the leaves into the water. \
At the beginning of the game, the playing field is a pond with leaves covering the surface. The game is broken down into turns. During a turn, you can pick one of the 8 surrounding leaves onto which you can jump. After you jump from a leaf, it sinks. This spot is then filled in with water, and that ends your turn. If, at the beginning of a player's turn, the player's ant has no leaves onto which they can jump (no leaves in the immediate surroundings), then that player is eliminated from the game. The game continues like this, with remaining players taking turns, until only one ant is left.  This player is then deemed the winner of the game. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to move your pointer over the leaves and pick one of them. \
Press `<Enter>`  to execute the jump. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit the game. \
