Black is a two-player game. The game is played on an 8x8 square board. The goal of the game is to make an unbroken curve from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the game board. There are three types of figures in this game. The cross is always placed in the top left square. The bottom right square is always black. Players make their moves one by one. In each move, you must continue the curve on one of the adjacent squares. You may use only one figure for each turn. Make the effort not to force the curve outside the edges of the playing board. A player passing over the edges of playing field loses the game. You are winner if you are the first to complete the curve. \
Use `<Up\Down arrows>`  to choose the desired figure. \
Press `<Enter>`  to place this figure on playing board. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit the game. \
