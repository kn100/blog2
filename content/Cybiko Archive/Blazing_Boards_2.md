Version 1.2.47 \
Blazing Boards 2 means 2 players for twice the fun!!! Grab a friend for the most intense, mind-blowing skating action on the planet! If your buddies don't have a Cybiko computer, they're missing a real-deal. Your goal? Grab a pile o' points for nailing tricks while flying through the skateboard track in record time! Choose your challenge: multiplayer or single player. Slam and jam your opponent while stylin' on your skateboard. The dude with the more points is the BEST! Play solo to seek your fame in the Top 10! Time your ramp jumps to catch massive air for the most awesome tricks. Skate over 5 fire icons to earn a BLAZING board! Blazing is worth double trick points until you bail. Score the biggest rewards for landing a VARIETY of tricks. The more tricks you master, the more you score. For full detailed rules, visit our Web site: www.cybiko.com. \
Press `<Space>`  to go to the Game menu. \
Use the `<Left/Right arrows>`  to move side-to-side. \
Want to jump? Press `<Enter>` , dude. The longer you hold the button, the higher you jump. Want to grind? Line up with the rail. \
Tricks are hidden on the `<Arrows>` , `<Tab>` , `<Select>` , `<Ins>` , `<Enter>`  and `<Del>`  buttons. Here's some to get you started: \
`<Select>` `<Right arrow>`  = Frontside 180 \
`<Enter>` `<Down arrow>`  = High Jump \
`<Enter>`  then `<Tab>`  = 360 Spin \
`<Right arrow>`  on rail = Boardslide \
`<Tab>`  = Kickflip \
`<Del>` `<Right arrow>`  = No Comply \
`<Ins>`  = Coffin \
`<Select>`  when on fire = 540 Shove-It \
