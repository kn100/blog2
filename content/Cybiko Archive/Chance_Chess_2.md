The differences between Chess and Chance Chess are as follows: the initial position of the pieces is chosen randomly every time you play so that all pawns are placed in their normal positions and the other pieces are placed on the first row for White and the eighth for Black. The black pieces are positioned in the same way as the white pieces, the king must be placed somewhere between the rooks and the player's two bishops must be positioned on squares of different colors. Castling is done in the following way: when castling with the "left" rook, the king moves to c1 for white, c8 for black, and the rook moves to d1 for white, d8 for black.  When castling with the "right" rook, the king moves to g1 for white, g8 for black, and the rook moves to f1 for white, f8 for black. See standard Chance Chess rules and the differences in this variation at our site, www.cybiko.com. \
Press `<Arrows>`  to move the pointer. \
Castling is defined by the king's move: choose the king and press `<C>`  to castle to the c-field, or press `<G>`  to castle to the g-field. \
Press `<Enter>`  to select a figure or to move it. \
Press `<Select>`  to switch the pawn when it reaches the opposite side. \
If you want to see your rating and that of your opponent, press `<R>` . Press `<Enter>`  to close the rating box. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit the game. \
