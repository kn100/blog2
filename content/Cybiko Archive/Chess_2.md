Chess is two-player game. Each player controls an army: light or dark. The light color always moves first. A move is a transfer of a piece to another square that is either vacant or occupied by a partner's piece. If the square is occupied, the partner's piece is captured. Each piece moves in a specific way. \
When a pawn reaches the last square on the opposing side of the board, it is promoted - that is, converted to any other piece of the same color. Castling is a special maneuver between the king and one rook and allowed only under specific conditions. \
Each player's goal is to attack the enemy king so that the king cannot prevent the attack or escape. When a king is attacked, it is in check. The player whose king is in check must attempt to escape on the next move. If he can't do this then the king is checkmated. The player who is checkmated loses. A tie, called a draw, is neither a win nor a loss for either side. \
Each player has a limited amount of time, and if this time is exceeded, the player loses. \
