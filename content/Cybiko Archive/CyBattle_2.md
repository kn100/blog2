Each player has two 10x10 square fields (own and enemy's). Each fleet consists of one aircraft carrier (a four-square ship), two cruisers (three-square ships), three torpedo boats (two-square ships), and four submarines (one-square ships).Ships can be placed on the field horizontally or vertically. They can't come into contact with one another. \
One of the players chooses a square from which they attack the enemy's field. If an enemy ship is hit, the player takes the next turn and chooses one more square. If the player misses, the turn is given to the opponent. \
If there's a hit, the chosen square is marked by a blinking cross. If there's a miss, the square is marked by a point. A ship sinks when all of its squares are hit. The adjacent squares of a sunken ship are marked with points. \
The winner of CyBattle is the first player who sinks the enemy's fleet. If a player's time runs out, that player loses the game. For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com. \
