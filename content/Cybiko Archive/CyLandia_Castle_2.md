Version 2.1.33 \
CyLandia Castle 2 is a single-player game of 14 levels. The object of the game is to help your Cy-B make it through the final gate of the sinking tower and to score as many points as you can along the way. To complete a level, guide your Cy-B up the tower and through an exit, while dodging the perilous creatures that haunt the castle. Your Cy-B might cross paths with Flying Spider, Bloody Hannibal, Marmoset, and the Apelike Sack (a creepy bag bursting with marmosets, which crawl out of it from time to time). To get around, your Cy-B can climb the castle's stone walls, or catch a ride on an elevator. He can also step inside a Gate to hide from enemies. Your Cy-B's arsenal includes a pistol (always on hand), plus a Tommy gun, a grenade launcher and a rocket projector can be picked up along the way. Your Cy-B can also collect power-ups around the tower: a health pack, cartridges for the Tommy gun, an ammo pack for charging the grenade launcher and the rocket projector, and a pack of mines. You score points for each enemy your Cy-B destroys, plus bonus points when you complete each level. Your Cy-B loses a life and many points with it when his health runs out, or if he falls in the lake. The game is over if your Cy-B has to return to the starting point that has already been submerged. When your Cy-B passes the 14th and last level, you win the game. \

Use `<Up arrow>`  to jump. \
Press `<Enter>`  to enter the gate inside the tower. \
Press `<Select>`  to select a weapon. \

Note that the above keys may be redefined upon your wish. \
Press `<Esc>`  to go to the Game Menu. \
