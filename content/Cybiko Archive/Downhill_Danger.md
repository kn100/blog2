This is the single player game. The object of the game is to guide a skier through a slalom course, avoiding trees and passing in between the flags that define the course, all in an attempt to attain the fastest run through the course. \
While skiing down the course, try to pass through all the gates and avoid all trees along the way. Maintain a high speed in the run in order to show a better time, but remember that a high speed results in the loss in maneuverability. A 10-second penalty will be added to your time for each missed gate. If you collide with a tree, you significantly lose your speed, and a 20-second penalty is added to your time. \
The game ends when you reach the finish line. Finish with a good time and you may be included in the Top Ten. \
Press `<Left/Right arrows>`  to steer the skier left or right. \
Press `<Select>`  to accelerate. \
Press `<Enter>`  to decelerate. \
Press `<Tab>`  to view the Top Ten list. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart the game. \
