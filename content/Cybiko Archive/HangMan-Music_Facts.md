Version 1.1.1 \
This is a single-player word game. The object of the game is to guess a word, letter by letter, while making the fewest wrong guesses as possible. This Hang Man game has the theme of "music facts." \
You may define the difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Custom. The difficulty level determines the session length (how many words you want to guess in the game), the presence or lack of hints, etc. \
Each word is presented as a series of blank lines. Each line is a non-guessed letter in the word. You suggest a letter from the alphabet. If that letter is one of the characters in the word, then it is placed into the word. Otherwise the picture of a hung man is begun or continued! One man is hung if you guess incorrectly six times. When you guess one word, the next word will be presented to you.  \
The game ends when you guess all the words in the session. Then the number of hung men is counted and you will see your result. \
The "Settings" screen allows you to adjust the game options. \
Use `<Up/Down arrows>`  to select the item or button "Start." \
Use `<Select>`  or `<Left/Right arrows>`  to choose a setting of the item. For the numeric input field, use numeric keys to set its value. \
Press `<Enter>`  to accept the change. Press `<Esc>`  to reject the change. \
Choose the "Start" button and press `<Enter>`  to start the game. \
To suggest a letter, use `<Arrows>`  or press the alpha key to set the pointer over it and press `<Enter>`  or `<Select>` . Attention: If you've switched on "Hot Keys" in the settings of this game, when you press an alpha key it will automatically be selected. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit. \
