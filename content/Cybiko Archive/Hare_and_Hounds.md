This is an old French game of logic. One player controls five hounds and the other player presents one hare. The playing field is a 31 cells board. A hound can move forward only to a directly connected cell, the hare can move at any direction it wants to a directly connected cell! The hare is caught if the dogs corner it and it has nowhere to run! The hare wins if it reaches the farthest left column, or there are more than three hounds to the right of it! To make a move you must first select the moving figure then select the cell you want it move to. If the figure is the hare, it is selected automatically, so you only have to move to the desired cell. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to move the pointer. \
Use `<Enter>`  or `<Select>`  to select/unselect a cell or to move. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit. \
