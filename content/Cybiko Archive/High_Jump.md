This game can be played with two to five players, or you can play it yourself without partners. Each player controls an athlete who has to attempt a jump. The object of the game is to make the highest jump. During each turn, your athlete gets 2 attempts to successfully complete the jump. In any one attempt, your athlete must run up on the track and to jump as high as he can over a bar without knocking it from its supports. If you are unsuccessful in first attempt, try once more! After the second failure, you are eliminated from the game. All players continue their attempts until only one person remains in the game. This player is then considered the winner. \
To make the athlete run, you must continuously hit `<Left arrow>` , followed by `<Right arrow>` , in succession. The faster you can alternate between `<Left arrow>`  and `<Right arrow>` , the faster the athlete will run. \
To jump hold `<Enter>`  to select the angle of jump and then release `<Enter>` . The longer you hold `<Enter>`  the greater the angle will be. When the indicator reaches the greatest angle (vertical line), your athlete will jump automatically. \
Press `<Enter>`  again (when the athlete is in the air) to change the position of your athlete and to avoid touching the bar. \
Press `<Enter>`  once more and jumper tucks their legs up to ensure clearing the bar. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit. \
