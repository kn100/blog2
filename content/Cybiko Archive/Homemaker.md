This is a single player game with the goal to score the most points. You have two cranes that continuously move their hooks up and down. You control left and right movements of both cranes simultaneously. \
The house blocks are at the bottom buffer. When the crane hook reaches the buffer it catches a block. You have to control the crane so that it places the block correctly in constructing house when it goes down with the block. \
A block is considered correctly placed if it: occupies the correct level and for some blocks the condition of combination with other block takes into account; doesn't form the gap with the surrounding blocks; fully stands on the block of previous level. Each correctly fulfilled item scores 1 point. \
The game has three levels. Next level can begin if you score definite number of points: you can start the next level yourself or if a block doesn't have the place to land the next level will start automatically. \
The game ends if a block doesn't have the place to land and you don't have enough point to start next level. You pass all levels if you score 414 points. \
For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com \
Use `<Left/Right arrows>`  to control the cranes. \

If you see that score bar passes the line you can press `<Enter>`  to start next level. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart the game. \
