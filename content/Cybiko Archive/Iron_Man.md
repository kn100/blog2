This is a single player game where you have to pass all five levels and free the hostages. You move in the building by using the elevator to go up. If you free a hostage on the floor in a limited time and lead him/her to the elevator you go to the next level. First, find the key that will open the door of the room where the terrorists have hidden the hostage. If terrorists hit you 10 times you lose one of your three lives. Stand still for a while to refill your endurance. Find the baton to kill the first enemy. You'll get his gun and will be able to see the map, showing the floor plan and your enemies' positions. Find bonuses: ammunition, medicine chest and the key. Try to hide each dead enemy, using a stove, or he'll be replaced when someone finds him. You win the game if you free the hostage on the fifth level. The game also ends if you lose all your lives or are too slow to save the hostages. \
