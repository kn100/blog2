Version 1.1.3 \
Mars Explorer is a single-player action game. The object of the game is to attain the highest score by obtaining minerals from surface of the planet Mars while avoiding or destroying different obstacles. You control a planetary surface exploration vehicle. The more minerals you get, the higher your score will be. At the beginning of the game, you have 4 lives. There are 3 obstacles in this game: Cracks (if your vehicle runs over one of these cracks, the vehicle will flip upside down, and you will lose one life); Volcanoes (Since volcanoes have a slope, the vehicle jumps it like a ramp, causing the vehicle to go off the surface of the planet. As a result you lose one life); Meteors are large rocks (You must time your jump so that you avoid a collision with a meteor, or jump so that you have enough time to shoot the meteor with a stone before the collision occurs. Upon collision with a meteor, your vehicle explodes and you lose one life). Your vehicle has thrusters on the bottom that allow the vehicle to jump very high distances. A Thrust Meter will show you how high you will jump. The game has 10 levels. On each level, you can find mineral bonuses that are airborne. To get them you have to jump! When you lose all 4 lives, the game is over. If you pass all of the levels, you will be a successful explorer of the Mars surface. \
Press `<Up arrow>`  to jump over cracks. The longer you hold `<Up arrow>` , the higher the jump will be. The jump will be completed when you release `<Up arrow>` . Don't hold `<Up arrow>`  button too long when choose the height of jump. You can go off the screen. \
Press `<Enter>`  to shoot a stone. \
Press `<Tab>`  to view the Top Ten list. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart the game. \
