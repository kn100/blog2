You can invite up to four friends to join you in this game. The object of the game is to be the last remaining player. In the game cycle one player is a challenger and the others are followers. If player-challenger hits the rim, then all other players get one chance at making a counter shot - a shot from the place where player-challenger scored, correctly guessing the shot power needed to score a hit from the selected location. \
If any player-follower misses the counter shot, that player will get the next sequential letter from the word "PIG" held against him/her.  Each player who scores the word "PIG" leaves the game - he/she is a game loser. \
If player-challenger misses, the next player becomes a challenger.  \
For detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to define the position of the shot if you are a challenger, and then press `<Enter>` . \
Hold `<Enter>`  to define the strength of the shot. \
Release `<Enter>`  to shoot. \
Press `<Select>`  to turn on/off the power meter sound. \
Press `<Tab>`  to switch on/off the overhead screen when you are in the 3D screen. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit. \
