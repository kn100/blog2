There are numbers falling from the top of the screen. You can control the falling numbers to group them so that the sum of the numbers in a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) equals ten. If a "ten" line comes in, all the numbers disappear and your score increases greatly. If you combine five 2's in a line, you score 1000 points. \
The next level begins if playing field is cleared or every 5,000 points you score. The game is over when one column is full. \
Your goal is to score the most points and to pass as many levels as possible. \
Press `<Left/Right arrows>`  to move a falling number. \
Press `<Down arrow>`  to accelerate a drop of the falling number. \
Press `<Enter>`  to pause the game. Press `<Enter>`  again to resume the game. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart the game. \
