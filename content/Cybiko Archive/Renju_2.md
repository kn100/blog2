Renju is played between two opponents, White and Black, on a 15x15 intersections board. The first player who gets an unbroken line of five stones - whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally - wins the game. Black is prohibited from making a double three, a double four and an overline - more than five stones. If Black makes one of these patterns either accidentally or by being forced, the player loses the game. Black plays the first three moves of the game: first black stone at the center intersection, white stone in direct connection with the black stone and second black stone on an empty place within a zone of 5x5 intersection with the same center as the center intersection according to the Renju opening patterns. White has the right to change sides instead of the fourth move. There are no restrictions on the fifth and later moves. \
The game can be over if one of the players exceeds the game time, then the other player is a winner. \
For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to select the intersection. \

Press `<Tab>`  to change sides (only for White on fourth move). \
If you want to see your rating and that of your opponent, press `<R>` . Press `<Enter>`  to close rating box. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit the game. \
