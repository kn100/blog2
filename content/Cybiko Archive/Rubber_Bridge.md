Version 1.1.10 \
Rubber Bridge is a four-player card game in which the object is to get points - the more the better. The game is played in pairs (North-South against East-West) and consists of two parts: bidding and playing. The game is played clockwise. Bridge has rather complicated rules; it's impossible to explain them this briefly. For the full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com. \
