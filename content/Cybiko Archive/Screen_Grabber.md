This program allows you to obtain (grab) screen shots (or dumps) from the Cybiko screen while playing a game or using an application. Dumps are stored on a flash under names such as grab001.pic, grab002.pic, etc. You can look at them by using the Graphic Editor or Uploader&File Manager applications. With the help of Graphic Editor, you can edit these obtained pictures. \

In top line you'll see the current key or key combination. \
In the next two lines, you'll see the four buttons that you can choose to use as keys for grabbing pictures. \
The `<Shift>`  and `<Fn>`  buttons are used to compose key combinations. \
Press `<Enter>`  to choose a desired key or key combination for grabbing pictures. \
Press `<Enter>`  or the "Ok" button to confirm your choice, or the "Cancel" button to reject it. \
