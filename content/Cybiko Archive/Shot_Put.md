This game can be played with one to five players. Each player controls an athlete who has to throw the shot. The object of the game is to make the longest Shot Put throw. Each player gets 3 turns in the game, and the longest throw of the 3 turns is used for each player. During each turn, your athlete must run on the racetrack in a straight line and throw (at a selected angle) the shot to the landing field (where the shot lands after being thrown) without stepping over the foul line. The throw distance is determined (by measuring the distance from the foul line to the spot in the landing field where the shot landed) and displayed. The next player takes the next turn, and this repeats until all players have had 3 turns. After each player has finished 3 turns, the best throw from each player is compared, and the players are ranked from the longest to the shortest throw. \
To make the athlete run, you must continuously hit `<Left arrow>` , followed by `<Right arrow>` , in succession. The faster you can alternate between `<Left arrow>`  and `<Right arrow>` , the faster the athlete will run. \
To put the shot, hold `<Enter>`  to select the angle of throw and then release `<Enter>` . The longer you hold `<Enter>` , the greater the angle will be. When the indicator reaches the greatest angle (which is a vertical line), your athlete will throw the shot automatically. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit. \
