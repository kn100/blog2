The game space is a checkered 5x5 rectangle. Each player has 12 counters - black or white. This game has two stages. \
In the first stage, the players take turns placing two counters at a time on an unoccupied square of the board. The counters cannot be placed on the center square. \
In the second stage, each player moves a counter. The counter cannot jump over another counter. However, the counter can move to an unoccupied adjacent square in any direction. If there are no longer any squares to move in, the player loses. The move is considered unacceptable if the counter of the partner is blocked up between two of your counters (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). The blocked up counter or counters are captured and removed from the board. In the case of an unacceptable move, you have to move again. If not - the move is passed to the partner. Note: counter is considered blocked only in the second stage, not in the first during placement. \
The game continues until the player with only two counters left loses. The game ends in draw if each player makes 20 acceptable moves. \
Each player has the game time - the time for a player's own moves. If you exceed this time you lose. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to move the pointer. \
In the first stage, press `<Enter>`  to place your counter. \
In the second stage, press `<Enter>`  to pick up and to move your counter. \
Press `<R>`  to see your and the opponent's ratings. Press `<Enter>`  to close rating box. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit the game. \
