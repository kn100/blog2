Your spaceship has a limited shield that suffers damage when any encounter with an object or a spaceship occurs. You can pick up some power-ups, which can increase the level of protection and ammo. The game has four stages. Each next stage demands more bravery and accuracy. Your goal is to complete the breakthrough! \
