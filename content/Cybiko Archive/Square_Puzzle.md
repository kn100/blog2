This is a two-player strategic game played on a dotted board. The players place lines (a line connects two unconnected dots) on the board. When a box is created with four lines, it's marked with the color of the player who places the complete line in the box. If the player creates a box, he takes the next turn. Otherwise, the players place their lines in turn.  \
The goal of the game is to make as many boxes as possible by the end of the game. \
The player who creates the most boxes is the winner.  \
The game ends if there is no place for a line (the board is full). \
Use `<Arrows>`  to select a position for your line. \
Press `<Select>`  or `<Tab>`  to choose a line orientation (horizontal or vertical). \
Press `<Enter>`  to place a line. \
Press `<Esc>`  to quit the game. \
