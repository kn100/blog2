This is a single player game. There are three divers in the boat. One diver can go down by safety rope to the ocean floor. The goal of the game is to get the most treasures. There is a trunk with treasures, and when the diver comes closer to the trunk, he can take the treasures from it. As the number of treasures you have increases, the speed at which game is played is increased. The enemies include: the Neptune who throws tridents, the fishes, and the octopus who moves its tentacles. Any encounter with enemy objects removes some health-points of a diver. \
A diver can get health packs to increase the health-points. He can restore all health-points if he returns to the boat. A diver is destroyed if he loses all of his health. \
A diver needs to have a reserve of oxygen. He can fill up his oxygen resources if he returns to the boat. If the oxygen is exhausted the diver is lost. The number of divers is restored to three when you get 200 and/or 500 treasures. \
If you lose all your divers, the game ends. You are a winner if you get more treasures than in the previous game. Otherwise, you lose. \
Use `<Up/Down arrows>`  to move by the rope. \
Use `<Left/Right arrows>`  to move by the ocean floor. \
To get treasures, move to the trunk and press `<Enter>` . \
To get a health pack, move a diver to it. \
Press `<Tab>`  to see the table of results. Press `<Enter>`  or `<Esc>`  to close the table. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart. \
