The object of the game is to clear the game board of all pictures. It seems so easy... at first. The problem is that every press of a button has an effect on the puzzle. Grid cells that are "On" will shut off while "Off" cells will turn on. Moreover, when you touch a button, the state of the currently selected grid cell flips and also the state of all surrounding grid squares changes (those that are directly above, below or next to the pressed button). The challenge of this game is to solve a puzzle in the minimum number of moves required, so plan your moves carefully. Each level has its own picture to fit inside the grid cells as well as the starting locations of the level picture in all "On" squares. The entire game consists of 10 levels. When you pass all levels the game will end. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to move highlight. \
Press `<Enter>`  to flip the state of the grid cell and all surrounding grid cells. \
Press `<Tab>`  to choose next level. \
Press `<Shift>` `<Tab>`  to choose previous level. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or to restart the level. \
