This is a single player game. The object of the game is to guide the chicken through the busy roadways in attempt to get the chicken to the other side of the road and to get the maximum number of points. \
When the game starts, you'll see a chicken at the bottom of the screen and a 2 lane highway with traffic passing in both directions. You control the chicken and must guide it across the road, all in an effort to reach the farm on the other side. Pick up the chicken feed along the way to obtain points. There are 10 levels in the game. Once you are able to guide the chicken to the land on the other side of the road, the next level starts. If the chicken gets run over by a car, it loses its life and the level begins again. Each new level has an increased number of lanes. Upon starting the game, you have four lives, and this number may increase to 6 if you pick up the special bonus hearts. The game ends if you successfully pass the 10th level or if you lose all your lives. When this happens, if your score is in the Top Ten, you are asked to enter your name to the Top Ten list. \
Use `<Arrows>`  to control the chicken. \
Press `<Up arrow>`  `<Left/Right arrows>`  to move the chicken forward to the left or right. \
Press `<Down arrow>`  `<Left/Right arrows>`  to move the chicken backward to the left or right. \
Press `<Ins>`  to show/hide informational field. \
Press `<Tab>`  to view the Top Ten list. \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or restart the game. \
