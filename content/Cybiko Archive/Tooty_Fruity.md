Version 1.1.24 \
The object of this single-player game is to achieve the highest score by grouping different fruits together on the playing field. You play the game with 7 different fruits that appear in random order, and can be shot in any direction from -60 degrees to 60 degrees. If you group the fruits of the same sort together, it will cause them to disappear from the playing field. There are 15 levels in the game. The minimum number of fruits in the chain depends on which level you are playing. To complete each shot, you are given a certain amount of time. If you don't have time to shoot, the fruit will be shot automatically as soon as the time runs down to zero. For each disappeared chain of fruits you get a certain amount of points. If the chain of fruits you have put together is more than established minimum number on the current level, not only that composed chain disappears, but all of the fruits that are situated in vertical rows above and below fruits from composed chain will disappear as well. The game is over when there is no place to put the fruit on the playing field or if a fruit that is shot in a certain direction doesn't find room and falls within the field. \
Use `<Left/Right arrows>`  to rotate an aiming indicator to aim the shot. \
Press `<Enter>`  to shoot the fruit in the direction in which you are aiming. \
Use `<Shift>`  to pause the game. \
Use `<Select>`  to interchange the current and the next fruit. \
Press `<Esc>`  to load the Game Menu. \
