This is a strategy based multi-player game that can be played with one to three other people.  The playing field is 9x9 squares board. Each player has three different pieces in the game: viruses, forts and trenches. Your fort is alive as long as your own virus is near it, so be careful, and make sure your opponent does not infect you!  Your available virus position is near your virus or near your living fort. \
Each player makes three moves in one turn. One move can be: \
Virus - in available virus position if square is not occupied. \
Fort - if in available virus position the opponent's virus already stands, you can replace it by your fort. \
Trench - at any square with your virus. \
The first move you make will designate your personal corner from which you do battle! \
If all opponents' viruses are "killed" - you win the game. If all your viruses are "killed" - you lose the game. \
To place your piece, use the `<Arrows>`  to select a square. The info field will tell you which piece you can place in that square (virus, fort, trench or nothing). Then press `<Enter>` . \
Press `<Esc>`  to exit or to propose a draw. \
