Version 1.1.47 \
This is the game for two to five players, and it simulates the stock exchange. The object of the game is to earn the most money. There are 4 types of stocks in the game: clubs, diamonds, spades and hearts. Upon starting the game, each player has $100 and 6 cards. Your cards show you the options that you may perform with each type of action. Your goal is to manipulate the cost of the stocks in order to buy the maximum stocks for lowest cost and to sell them for most expensive price.  \
During each turn, you first change the cost of any types of the stocks, and then you buy/sell any stocks. The game ends when your cards are all played. The player that gets the most money wins. For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com. \
