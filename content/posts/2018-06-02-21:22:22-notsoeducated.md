A while ago, I and a friend of mine got rather annoyed at a ridiculous propaganda attempt called "Not So Safe", claiming that Electronic Cigarettes were extremely dangerous, so we countered it by parodying the complete lies with a website in the same shape, which contained well cited research. We called it Not So Educated.

They've long since taken the site down, I suspect in response, but you can still somewhat experience it thanks to the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150819060251/http://notsosafe.org:80/).

You can also experience NotSoEducated, thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150801222634/http://notsoeducated.org/).

Compared to cigarettes, they are much less toxic. Quote. Cadmium, lead and nickel have also been detected but in trace levels only, comparable with levels in Nicorette inhalers. Citation.
