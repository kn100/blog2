So, it turns out that a lot of smart gear from many manufacturers, including ones
you've almost certainly heard of, comes from a company called Tuya. They
seem to make all sorts of fun IOT gear, which all connects to the Tuya cloud.
What Tuya seem to do is sell whitelabeled 'versions' of their products to various
brands who then sell them as if they'd manufactured them themselves. Very
interesting right?

There exist many projects to de-cloud these products.
One such project is called Tuya-convert. Tuya convert is a tool which emulates
the update server these plugs connect to in order to deliver custom firmware to
the plug that it can run. This project is amazing, since it gives you the option
of declouding IOT gear without having to do any hardware modification at all.
Unfortunately, it seems this project is dead in the water right now since Tuya
is playing the typical cat and mouse game with the developers, and currently
Tuya is winning.

I wanted to open my plug up next, in order to figure out what made it tick.
Opening it was fairly difficult, given that it is held together with nothing but
clips. After running a guitar pick around the seam a few times, I finally
managed to pop the cover. What I found really surprised me. There was a board in
there that looked suspiciously like an ESP based platform. Further searching led
me to realise that the board in there that handles all the 'smart' of the plug
is actually an implementation of the ESP8285 - which is a cheaper (but just as
hackable) variant of the ESP8286, which is related to the ESP32.

Consulting the easily accessible datasheet for the TYWE-2s - we can quickly
identify the serial pins, and solder wires to them. Then, we can connect it up
to some Serial to USB adaptor and could flash whatever code we wanted to the ESP.
I however wanted a nicer solution. I found Tasmota. Tasmota is another open source
project that runs on these plugs that allows you to connect them up to HomeAssistant
or similar. It works really well. Read on for the process:

1. Buy a WiFi plug.

2. Open it up, in order to figure out where the serial pins are. We can see on mine,
there is a nice TYWE-2S module which unfortunately due the construction of this plug
has awkward to access serial pins.

Above is a view of the pins we need access to. Unfortunately, the two options you have for getting access to them are to desolder the enormous blobs of solder holding the mains plug pins on, or to cut into the case. I went with cutting into the case. Ugly, but works.

3. Put it back together, and cut a hole where the pins you need are. Below is a view of the hole I cut. I cut it using a hacksaw and a hot knife. Uuuugly.

{{< figure src="/posts/plug-hack/plug-pins.jpg" alt="A close up showing the pins through the hole I cut earlier" >}}

See [here](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/device-development/module/wifi-module/we-series-module/wifie2smodule?id=K9605u79tgxug) for a data sheet to help identify which pins are which.

4. Solder some female jumper wires to the pins we need access to, and connect them to
the serial interface. You'll want to make especially super sure that your interface
is clever enough to support 3.3v logic level input. Otherwise you risk frying the
board or just failing to flash the board repeately. Ask me how I know.

5. Grab [Tasmotiser](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) and follow the instructions. Make very sure your wifi details are correct, otherwise you'll end up having to flash the plug a second time.

6. Once your Tasmotised plug is up, and you can control it from a web interface, it's time
to interface it with your HomeAssistant install. Your Home Assistant install must already
have the MQTT integration. Ensure you enable *discovery* in your Home Assistant MQTT config.

{{< figure src="/posts/plug-hack/plug-mqtt-discovery.png" alt="A screenshot showing MQTT Discovery in Home Assistant as being enabled" >}}

7. Go back to the web server for your WiFi Plug. Configure the MQTT server to connect to
the MQTT server your Home Assistant is connected to.

8. In this same interface, head to console, and type `SetOption19 1`. This causes the plug
to emit an autodiscovery message which should mean Home Assistant picks up on your plug and
you should now be able to control it in Home Assistant, sans cloud!
