**Note:** Inside this article are instructions for disassembling your Cybiko and modifying it. You do this at your own risk, obviously, and I do not take any responsibility nor guarantee everything will work the way it did for me. Be careful!

# The battery problem
Unfortunately old, long term unused Cybiko Classics suffer from exploded
batteries. Worse, the residue will eat away at the original battery contacts,
and will even begin to damage the motherboard if left in for long enough.

{{< figure src="/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/cybiko-intro.jpg" alt="A neon green Cybiko" >}}

Get the batteries that are in there out as soon as possible, and clean the
battery contacts as well as the Cybikos own contacts as best you can. You may
also consider disassembling the Cybiko to clean any residue that may have gotten
to the motherboard. Do NOT mess with the LCD, the ribbon is incredibly flexible
and I have killed a unit fiddling. You could attempt to reuse the batteries, but
I would strongly suggest instead either finding replacements, or as a cheaper
and worse alternative doing what I did and attaching an alternative power
source. Two Ni-MH 1.2v AAA or AA batteries in a holder soldered to the battery
contacts will work just fine. It is also STRONGLY recommended you do NOT solder
directly to the batteries, and instead purchase a battery holder instead. Doing
a poor job of soldering to the batteries at best can cause irreparable damage
to the battery, and at worst can cause a catastrophic failure.

# Hardware to connect to Cybiko Classic

If you do not have the serial cable bundled with the Cybiko, you should know
that they're practically impossible to find. If do not mind making a small
after-market modification to the Cybiko, you will need to do some soldering work
to add some wires, which we will later attach to an RS232 port. This is
necessary because Cybiko used a proprietary connector and as far as I can tell no
other device used this connector, and therefore the cables are becoming quite
rare.


The Cybiko motherboard has a number of test points, and thankfully four of them
are exactly what we need to solder to in order to bring the serial connection it
uses to connectors we can actually connect to. See the diagram below which
highlights each test point. I suggest using the thinnest insulated wire you can
get your hands on, in order to make running them inside the Cybiko as easy as
possible. One possible egress point for these wires would be the hole on the
right hand side of the battery compartment. I also suggest at this point making
a note of whichever colour you soldered to each test point, so once you
reassemble the Cybiko, you know which is which.

{{< figure src="/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/cybiko-serial-testpoints.jpg" alt="the test points you need to solder to (TP47,48,49, and somewhere for ground)" >}}

TP47 is TXDL, which goes to the RXD of your RS232 adaptor, TP48 is RXDS, which
goes to TXD of your serial adaptor, TP49 is RTS, and the black pin that I've
stuck on the side of the reset switch is GND, because the outside of the reset
switch is grounded, so you can just solder there, or anywhere else you can find
ground." title="TP47 is TXDL, which goes to the RXD of your RS232 adaptor, TP48
is RXDS, which goes to TXD of your serial adaptor, TP49 is RTS, and the black
pin that I've stuck on the side of the reset switch is GND, because the outside
of the reset switch is grounded, so you can just solder there, or anywhere else
you can find ground.

Once the wires are outside of the Cybiko, you can then attach them to an RS232
DB-9 male connector. I suggest picking up a DB-9 break out board, [like this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09LXQW2YK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B09LXQW2YK&linkCode=as2&tag=kn100-21&linkId=0dc4a3c82607536e8ce794b037cd457a).
Attach each of the 4 wires to the 4 points on the DB-9 connector matching TX,
RX, RTS, and GND.

If in the very likely case your computer does not have a serial port, you can
pick up a DB-9 Male Serial to USB adaptor [like this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00QUZY4UG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00QUZY4UG&linkCode=as2&tag=kn100-21&linkId=f3112c2b43c76feb0a0c360c18693186).

With all this, you're ready to connect.

# If you have a Windows XP computer to hand

**A safety note regarding Windows XP**: I strongly encourage you to not connect
it to the internet if you can help it. It is NOT a secure operating system and
should not have unfettered internet access. Copy files you need to and from it
via USB sticks or similar.

Plug in your Cybiko via your serial adaptor or similar. If you are using the
official Cybiko cable and are connecting to a real RS232 port on your computer,
you can stop here. If you are using a USB to serial device, you might need to
install its drivers: Open device manager (Start > Run > `devmgmt.msc` > OK), and
verify that you can see your serial device (It'll be under Ports (COM & LPT) if
it is installed correctly and no yellow triangle will appear on it). If you find
it under Unknown devices or there is a yellow triangle, you will need to install
the drivers for your serial adaptor. Follow your vendors instructions for how to
do that.


# If you do not have a Windows XP computer to hand
One solution to not having a computer of this vintage is to virtualise one. This
isn't too difficult.

1. Plug in your Cybiko via your serial adaptor or similar.

2. Install Virtualbox. It can be gotten from your favourite Linux package
   manager, or see [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for
   download links for less good operating systems.

3. Acquire installation media for Windows XP. I can't help you with this one.

4. From within Virtualbox, select the "New" option.

5. Give your virtual machine a descriptive name, and ensure that Type is set to
   "Windows XP" and Version is set to "Windows XP (32 bit)". The 32 bit option
   is important. Ask me how I know.

6. Select whichever RAM size you would like, 1GB or greater recommended.

7. Create the virtual disk with whichever size you like.

8. After the wizard has finished, right click it and select settings. Select USB
   on the left, and then click the USB Plus (+) icon on the right. A list should
   pop up listing all your USB devices. One of these should be your serial
   adaptor. Select it.

**Note**: If you do not see any USB devices listed, you may be running Linux and
therefore may need to run `sudo adduser $USER vboxusers` in a terminal in order
to add your user to the Virtualbox users group. If you're not on Linux, dunno
lol.

9. Select "OK". Double click your virtual machine.

10. From the popup that appears, select your Windows XP installation media and
    follow through with the Windows XP installation procedure.

11. Once you are at the desktop, you'll want to install the Virtualbox Guest
    Additions. You do this by selecting "Devices" at the top of the Virtualbox
    window, and selecting "Insert Guest Additions CD". Then open "My Computer"
    from within the virtual machine, open the CD that is now there, and select
    "VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe".

12. Follow the installation prompts, and reboot when prompted.

13. Open device manager (Start > Run > `devmgmt.msc` > OK), and verify that you
    can see your serial device (It'll be under Ports (COM & LPT) if it is
    installed correctly and no yellow triangle will appear on it. If you find it
    under Unknown devices or there is a yellow triangle, you will need to
    install the drivers for your serial adaptor. Follow your vendors
    instructions for how to do that.

# Cyberload setup and initial connection

Cyberload is a piece of software released with the Classic. It was superseded by
EZ Loader, however I actually prefer Cyberload for Classics. Its purpose was to
download the game/app catalogue from Cybiko.com (long gone), and to send games
to the Cybiko.

{{< figure src="/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/cybiko-cyberload.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the Cyberload software running in a virtual machine. Memories!" >}}


1. Get a copy of the UK Cyberload from [here](https://kn100.me/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/Cybikofiles/Cybiko-CyberloadSetupUK.exe), or the US version of Cyberload from [here](https://kn100.me/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/Cybikofiles/Cybiko-CyberLoadSetup.exe).

2. After installation, open Cyberload. If it doesn't pick up on your Cybiko
   being plugged in, try powering the Cybiko entirely off (hold the escape key
   for around 10 seconds) and switching it back on while connected to the
   computer. You'll know you're connected once the Cybiko displays "Connected to
   PC" and the software shows your Cybikos ID on the right hand side. If you
   cannot get past this step, ensure your connections to your RS232 adaptor are
   correct!

3. You can now peruse the 'Help' section within Cyberload to learn about the
   various features of Cyberload.

# Uploading software

To upload software to the Cybiko that you have found (for example, from [here](https://archive.org/details/cybiko)), follow the below instructions. I should also note I built the [Cybiko Game Archive](https://cybiko.kn100.me/) which lists every game that was ever released for the Cybiko, along with a description.

1. Counterintuitively, we need to move a file from your Cybiko to your PC, so
   that Cyberload creates directories on your local machine. To do this, select
   a file from the right hand side of Cyberload, and then press `<= Move`.

2. Check `C:\Program Files\Cybiko\CyberLoad\Local Files` and you should now see
   a folder called `From Cybiko Computer XXXXXXXX` where XXXXXXXX is your Cybiko
   ID. Inside there will be a folder called Device Flash. Copy your desired
   software into there.

3. Close and reopen Cyberload. The software should now appear on the left, and
   you can move it using the `move` button.

4. Close Cyberload, and disconnect your Cybiko.

# Updating your Cybiko to the latest CYOS

The latest version of CYOS for the Classic is 1.3 System Pack version 57/58. 58
is for the UK, 57 is for the US (this determines which RF profile your Cybiko
uses, since apparently there are different laws between the US and the UK). You
can see which version your Cybiko Classic is running right now by pressing the
`?` button at the desktop.

If you need to update it or simply would like to factory reset it, the process
is relatively simple.

1. Connect your Cybiko to a power source and also your computer.

2. Grab the Cybiko-Autoupdate-UK.exe file [here](https://kn100.me/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/Cybikofiles/Cybiko-AutoUpdateUK.exe) or
the US version [here](https://kn100.me/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/Cybikofiles/Cybiko-AutoUpdate.exe)

3. Run the update and wait patiently for the update to complete.

# Dealing with the Dark LCD problem

There is a problem I have seen with numerous Classic Cybiko units where the LCD
becomes almost unreadable with extremely poor contrast. Not entirely black, but
only viewable from extreme viewing angles. It seems to me this problem is
afflicting many Cybikos. I believe is due to their age, but have no further
diagnostic insight sadly.

One solution I came across was to use a piece of Cybiko software I recently came
across called LCD Setup 2,

1. Grab LCD Setup 2, which can be downloaded
   [here](https://kn100.me/posts/cybiko-classic-2022/Cybikofiles/Cybiko-LCD_setup_2.app). Push that to your Cybiko using your
   preferred method.

2. Run the software on the Cybiko and be careful, the wrong options can result
   in a white screen, requiring a full software reset to fix.

3. There are 5 values that are configurable here. I suggest firstly moving the
   cursor to the fifth value (the contrast), and increasing it to something like
   11. The other 4 values control the 'colours' the cybiko has. For my
   particular unit, the following values work well (31, 18, 14, 00, 11).

4. Press enter to persist, and then escape out of the app. Enjoy!
